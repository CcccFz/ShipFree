# Email overview

ShipFree includes a provider-based email system for transactional and marketing emails.

## Key files

- `src/lib/messaging/email` for provider selection and sending
- `src/components/emails` for React Email templates
- `src/components/emails/subjects.ts` for email subject lines

## Default behavior

If no real provider is configured, ShipFree falls back to the log provider and prints emails to the server console.

## Usage

```ts
import { sendEmail } from '@/lib/messaging/email'

await sendEmail({
  to: 'user@example.com',
  subject: 'Welcome',
  html: '<p>Welcome to ShipFree</p>',
  emailType: 'transactional',
})
```

## Email validation

`src/lib/messaging/email/validation.ts` provides:

- Full validation with MX checks (`validateEmail`)
- Fast validation without MX checks (`quickValidateEmail`)
