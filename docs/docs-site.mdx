# Docs site

ShipFree documentation is structured for Mintlify. The config lives in `docs/docs.json` and content pages are MDX files under `docs/`.

## Local preview

```bash
npm i -g mint
cd docs
mint dev
```

The docs server runs on `http://localhost:3000` by default.

## Navigation

Update `docs/docs.json` to add groups, pages, and ordering. Each page is referenced by its path without the `.mdx` extension.

## Frontmatter

Every MDX page includes frontmatter to define metadata:

```mdx
---
title: "Page title"
description: "Page description"
---
```

## Mintlify components

You can use built-in MDX components like `Info`, `Warning`, `Tip`, `Steps`, and `CodeGroup` to structure content.
