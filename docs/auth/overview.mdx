# Auth overview

ShipFree uses Better-Auth with a Drizzle adapter, email OTP, and optional social providers.

## Key files

- `src/lib/auth/auth.ts` for the server-side auth configuration
- `src/lib/auth/auth-client.ts` for client-side helpers
- `src/app/api/auth/[...all]/route.ts` for Next.js route handlers

## Email OTP flow

Email OTP is enabled through Better-Auth plugins and uses the email system for delivery.

- OTP length is 6 digits
- OTP expires after 15 minutes
- OTP emails go through `sendEmail` in `src/lib/messaging/email`

## Email verification

`EMAIL_VERIFICATION_ENABLED` toggles email verification enforcement. When verification succeeds, a welcome email is sent through `src/components/emails`.

<Info>
  If no email provider is configured, OTPs will be logged to the server console by the log provider.
</Info>

## Sessions

Session settings are in `src/lib/auth/auth.ts`:

- 30-day session expiry
- 24-hour refresh interval
- 1-hour fresh age
