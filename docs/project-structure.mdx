## Route groups

- `(auth)` contains login, register, reset password, and verify flows
- `(main)` contains authenticated app pages like the dashboard
- `(site)` contains marketing pages and premium purchase pages

## Server and client components

ShipFree is server-component-first. Client components are explicitly marked with `use client` when interactivity is needed.
