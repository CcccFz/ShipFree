# Webhooks

All payment provider webhooks are handled by a single route:

- `POST /api/webhooks/payments`

The handler verifies the signature for the active provider and uses the adapter to process the event and update the database.

## Configure your provider

- Stripe uses the `stripe-signature` header
- Polar uses the `polar-webhook-signature` header
- Lemon Squeezy uses the `x-signature` header

## Local development

When testing locally, point the provider webhook to your local dev URL using a tunneling tool and ensure the correct webhook secret is set.

<Info>
  The webhook handler updates `customer`, `subscription`, and `payment` tables based on the adapter result.
