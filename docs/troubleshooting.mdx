# Troubleshooting

## Auth redirects loop

- Verify `BETTER_AUTH_URL` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` match your domain
- Confirm cookies are allowed in your browser

## Email not sending

- Set `EMAIL_PROVIDER` and provider credentials
- Check server logs for the log provider output

## Webhook signature errors

- Confirm the correct webhook secret is set
- Ensure the correct header is sent by your provider
- Verify the webhook endpoint is `/api/webhooks/payments`

## Payments show missing price IDs

- Set the public price or product IDs in `.env`
- Ensure `config/payments.ts` references the correct IDs
