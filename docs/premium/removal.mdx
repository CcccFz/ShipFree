# Remove premium purchase

If you do not plan to sell the template itself, you can remove the premium purchase feature entirely.

## Delete folders

- `app/api/premium-purchase/`
- `app/api/webhooks/premium-purchase/`
- `app/[locale]/(site)/premium-purchase/`

## Delete files

- `lib/premium-purchase.ts`
- `lib/premium-purchase/hooks.ts`
- `app/[locale]/(site)/pricing/premium-button.tsx`

## Update pricing page

In `app/[locale]/(site)/pricing.tsx`:

- Remove the `PremiumButton` import
- Replace `<PremiumButton />` with a standard button or remove it

## Remove env vars

In `config/env.ts` and `.env`:

- Remove all `PREMIUM_PURCHASE_*` variables
- Remove `NEXT_PUBLIC_PREMIUM_PURCHASE_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`
- Remove `NEXT_PUBLIC_PREMIUM_PURCHASE_DISCORD_INVITE_LINK`

<Warning>
  Remove any Stripe webhooks pointing to `/api/webhooks/premium-purchase` after deleting the route.
</Warning>
