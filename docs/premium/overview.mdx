# Premium overview

The repository includes a premium purchase flow used to sell the template itself. This flow is separate from your app's billing system.

## What the premium flow does

- Creates a one-time Stripe Checkout session
- Verifies payment on success
- Collects GitHub email, GitHub username, and Twitter handle
- Stores purchase data in `premium_purchase`

## Key files

- `app/api/premium-purchase/*`
- `app/api/webhooks/premium-purchase/route.ts`
- `app/actions/premium-purchase.ts`
- `lib/premium-purchase.ts`
- `lib/premium-purchase/hooks.ts`

<Info>
  If you are a premium customer using the template, the purchase flow can be removed from your product after you are done selling the template itself.
